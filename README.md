# AutomatedLinkedInJobScraper
Program Summary:
 This automated program uses Python and Selenium to gather a list of job positions recommended by LinkedIn. It also visits each compamy that has either alumni or current connections that currently work for that company. From here the program can visit each persons profile but it has been commented out (still works when uncommented) becasue there is a limit of profile views that you can make. This program can be used to scrape other useful information such as gathering contact info, making connections with others and more.
